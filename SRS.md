- Goals:
  - Create an easy-to-use application to automate all the processes involved in the organization of a scientific conference
  
# 2. Overall Description

## 2.1 User Needs
- also called user requirements
- has to determine who is gonna use the program and how
- there are multiple types of users that means that the program must be able to perform for their needs
- are usually documented via narattive text
- while designing a software product is important to know what the needs are
- when the user is not able to communicate the entire needs and also because the information provided it also may be innacurate or incomplete the user requirements are consoidered separately from the sustem requirements (this job is done by the bussines analyst) 

## 2.2 Assumptions and Dependencies
It is assumed that:
- the user is familiar with an internet browser and also familiar with handling the keyboard and mouse
- the user has access to an internet browser since the application is a web-based application
- the user possesses decent internet connectivity
- the user possesses a valid email address

# 3. System Features and Requirements

## 3.1 Functional Requirements
The system must:
- provide the user with a means of creating an account and authenticating on the platform with their credentials (username/password)
- let the authenticated user perform the specific actions required for each phase of the conference (for any conference)
- change phases of the conference according to chosen deadlines
- present its public information to the users

## 3.2 External Interface Requirements

## 3.3 System Features
The system needs to be:
- able to logically behave as three seperate systems (Backend, Frontend, Database)
- able to run the website responsively(Should work on multiple devices and browsers)
- able to distinguish between different users when accessing the database
- **not sure** able to operate transparently on data that is spread across a variety of different databases
## 3.4 Nonfunctional Requirements
- Reliability: The system should be reliable even when a lot of users access it at the same time
- Data integrity: The stored data should not become corrupted.
- Quality: The system should be polished.
- Maintainability: The system should be easily maintained.
